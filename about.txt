Fun fact about myself: long time ago, decades ago, when I finished high school and had to decide what to do in the university, I choosed computer science. It was in 1997, we had no smarphones nor internet and I struggled a lot with something called MSDOS. My studies didn't go well and I stoped studying and started to work. Life is a mystery -> here I am again, learning computer science! Yay
