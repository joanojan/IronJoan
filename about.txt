Fun fact about myself: long time ago, decades ago, when I finished high school and had to decide what to do in the university, I choosed computer science. It was in 1993, we had no smarphones nor internet and I struggled a lot with something called MSDOS. My studies didn't go well and I stoped studying and started to work. Life is a mystery -> here I am again, learning computer science! Yay

another fun fact? well, I did struggle with my php full stack course in the IT Academy, because of the complexity of the software when using frameworks and so many tools... so here I am again!
